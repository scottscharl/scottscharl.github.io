title: "How to Start a Men's Group That Sticks Together"
---
story:
A few weeks ago, in the evening, as I sat at home alone, I received a phone call from a dear friend.

It was Thursday night, time for Kirk After Work.

My closest friends back in Phoenix were gathered together for beer and conversation at somebody's house.

In the fall of 2013, my friends and I had a problem.

We were bachelors living in Phoenix, Arizona, working for a local charter school group as elementary and middle school teachers.

keys:
- common interest among the members
- bit of familiarity, to get started, later, the group forms its own familiariy and others are added
- a theme/goal of some kind (ostensibly to read Kirk, but really to complain about teaching) BUT-- no agendas!
- a Name! branding matters, even to ourselves
- Good food and drink, and/or tobacco (chesterton quote)
- No interruptions by women
