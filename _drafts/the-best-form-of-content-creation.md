As I build the and share content online, I have been thinking a lot about what format is best.

My purposes for content creation are to:
1. Enjoy making something.
2. Build useful skills.
3. Demonstrate technical abilities (to potential collaborators or employers).
4. Help people decide if I'm someone they'd like to get to know.

Below I've ranked each of my types of content as regards

| Type        | Time Required |Complexity |
|:-----------|:---------------:|:---------:|
| Blog        |      2       | Low       |
| Podcast  |       5        | High       |
| Tutorial  |      3        | Med  |
| Tweetstorm  | 1           | Low |
| Vlog        | 4          | High|
