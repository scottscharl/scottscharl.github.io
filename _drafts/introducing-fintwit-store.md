At the end of last year I bit the bullet and decided to build my first-ever ecommerce project, [FinTwit.Store](https://fintwit.store "check out Fintwit.store"). Here's how I started.

## Target Market
I decided I wanted to target a niche market with clothing and personal items. My target customer is members of Financial Twitter, or "FinTwit". Since early 2019, I have enjoyed participating in this lively online community of professional investors, do-it-yourself stock traders, financial advisers, and writers. My favorites are listed on my [Who I Follow](/who-i-follow) page.

## Setup
This is an experiment, so minimal overhead is critical. I keep costs low in two ways:
* A Shopify Basic plan allows me to run the store for $29 per month.
* [Printify](https://printify.com), a print-on-demand vendor, stores the custom digital designs for my products. and other will actually create and ship orders to my customers as they come in. There is no cost to keep my Printify account open, so I can create and test new products as needed without additional cost.

I designed the products themselves using [Canva](https://canva.com), then fit the designs to blanks from Printify's print-on-demand catalog. From there, with the click of a button I imported the ready-to-sell products into my Shopify store.

## Marketing
Here's the difficult part. So far, my plan has been to try to drive engagement to my online store through the store's Twitter account [@fintwit.store](https://twitter.com/fintwitstore). With admittedly spotty consistency on my part and limited time devoted to this project, Shopify's metrics have shown that I am getting organic traffic to the site. To date my store has just under 210 views and no sales.

My next task is to build out:
* Some sort of content engine, possibly regular "Best of FinTwit" Twitter posts and/or an email.
* Email marketing that syncs with the store to follow up with customers create a cart, etc.

I'll post updates about this project soon! In the meantime, feel free to email me at [hello@scottscharl.com]({{ site.email }}) or [@{{ site.minima.social_links.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.minima.social_links.twitter }}) if your have any thoughts.
