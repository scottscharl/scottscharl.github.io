Interested in learning a bit about how dynamic websites work, I stumbled into the world of PHP.

Building this site myself using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) has been a fantastic intro to web development. But over time I've wanted to add features beyond what a static site can offer.

As I've learned, PHP has been around forever and can be used to connect a web page to external, dynamic content.
