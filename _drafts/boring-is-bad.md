I have decided to publish a series of posts. Each will explore a principle or truth that I consider central to my own thinking. Some of the posts will define first principles, and others might trend more whimsical or secondary. We'll see.

I'll measure the success of my project as follows: If everyone agrees with me, I will know that I have failed to communicate anything of substance.

Being a conflict-avoider by nature, I am reluctant to share my opinions publicly. Yet writing offers so many benefits that I cannot resist attempting it any longer. Here are the two key benefits:

First, by writing I will discover what I truly think. Attempting to communicate an idea to another via the written word fails if that idea is not fully formed.

Second, writing online offers an opportunity to engage with others across time and space, far beyond those I might chance to meet in person. A post I share today might resonate with someone next week, next year, or next decade. The reader might live down the street or on the other side of the world. If a piece of writing that I create today can help spark even one new friendship at some point in my life, the value is incalculable.

I aim to publish at least one piece per month going forward, and truly appreciate your feedback.
