title: "Become an Interesting Person through Rigorous Leisure"
---
I used to think of leisure as relaxation. Now, it means something entirely different to me.

Leisure is simply how you spend your time away from work.


Dull people watch Netflix and scrolls social media all day. Interesting people are always working at something. It could be professional or amateur.


What is it?
* individually
* shared publicly!
* compounds. always improving/tweaking, but YOU SHIP IT "real artists ship - s. jobs"

Why you should pick up rigorous leisure

point 1 - People w/ a hobby are interesting!

point 2 - Rigorous Leisure is more fulfilling

point 3 - In our day and age, you may never know what nerd-dom could turn into a business.
