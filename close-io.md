Hi Close team!

Your application asked how I'd sync a Google form with a Mailchimp subscriber list.

To accomplish this, I used Zapier. [You can view the exact Zap here](https://zapier.com/shared/289ce585622bca7dc219885fb5b6f8b611b8557d).

But don't take my word for it! Test my Zap to make sure it works:

1. Fill out the Google form below
2. In the next 15 min, you'll receive an email notifying you've been subscribed (don't worry, it's not a real subscription).

Thanks!
