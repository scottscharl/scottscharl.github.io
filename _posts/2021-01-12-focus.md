[Julian Shapiro](https://julian.com) reviews this checklist each morning before he starts work. It's a great reminder that you have agency over how you spend your day.  

> 1. Decide what has to happen today to maximize fulfillment by the day's end--not by the hour.
>
> 2. Delegate everything that can be delegated.
>
> 3. Start with what must be finished today.
>
> 4. Catch yourself when you procrastinate.
>
> You don't lack the time to do everything you want. You're just addicted to comfort.
