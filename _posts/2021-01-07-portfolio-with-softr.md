My wife, J. C. Scharl, is a writer. Using a no-code tool called [Softr]({{ softrlink }}), I built her a site to centralize links to all her published works in one place.

The data for each of her published works is housed in an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) database, which is super simple to maintain; She submits new works via a webform and can view or edit the data in a spreadsheet format.

Softr reads that data from Airtable and presents each item in a list on her portfolio site.

With just some light tweaking to get the design on-brand, the whole thing is now up and viewable by anyone on the internet.
