title: "Building Something in 2021"

This tweet was a great reminder to me. When the math is parsed out like this, it feels achievable!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few $100K/year revenue streams, for inspiration:<br><br>- 300 customers @ $29/mo<br>- 6 sales/day @ $45 each<br>- 1 sale/day @ $270 each<br>- 50 students/quarter @ $500 each<br>- 15 hrs/week @ $125/hr<br><br>No capital necessary. Parallelizable. Achievable as a one-person business.</p>&mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1344702487421358080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[J. C. Scharl](https://jcscharl.com) and I are both committed to building things in 2021. She has a growing [newsletter](https://wordhoard.substack.com), and just had a BIG win when one of her poems was [read aloud on the BBC on Christmas Eve](https://wordhoard.substack.com/p/a-very-british-christmas).

I've been learning quite a bit of coding, and trying to write regularly here on my blog. I have a couple of side projects in mind for 2021 that I'm going to share more about soon.

I hope you have a great New Year!
