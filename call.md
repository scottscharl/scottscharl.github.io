This calendar helps my friends and I avoid phone tag. There's no need to schedule a time if you'd like to keep it informal---just call my cell at one of the times below for a greater chance of catching me. If none of these times work, shoot me a text or [email me](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com) and we'll figure it out. Thanks!
