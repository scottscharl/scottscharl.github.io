Iâ€™m a husband, dad, and rookie coder in Colorado. I was born and raised in southeast Michigan, and after college spent six years in Arizona.

In 2019, I finally indulged my fascination with software and built my first website, scottscharl.com, on nights & weekends. I used a static-site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), to build it.

Currently, I'm earning to code though weekly lessons with my friend [Dave](https://davewasmer.com). My first project is a web app,[ðŸ¤–BirthdayBot](https://birthdaybot.carrd.co), which uses a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) frontend and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) backend.

I'm also looking for part- to full-time work in customer support in tech or financial services. If you know of an opportunity, please [email me](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com) or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_scharl). View my [resume here](/resume).
