        Jason and his business partner David Heinemeier Hansson are contrarians
        in the tech world. They built [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com)
        without venture capital investors,
        and have continued to remain independent for 20 years. They wrote a book
        about their business philosophy, ReWork, which is on my
        [reading list](/reading-list). I first heard Jason
        on [this episode](https://www.perell.com/podcast/jason-fried)
        of David Perell's podcast. Jason told the the story of Basecamp
        and fleshed out the company's healthy and reasonable ethos
         around productivity. All in all, Jason offers fascinating ideas that
        I will someday apply to my own company.
