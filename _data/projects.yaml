    I read poems for your enjoyment. The goal is to test my equipment
    and learn how to produce a podcast.
    I'm currently using [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/scottreadspoetry "Anchor.fm")
    to publish the recordings.
    [Check out my readings](/scott-reads-poetry "Listen here on scottscharl.com"),

    A no-code mobile app I built using [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com "Glide") that
    lists name, location, and contact info for all local breweries
    in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Users may save Favorites
    and to post reviews of each establishment.
    This was a fun mini-project! You could very easily make one for your town by cloning my app.
    Look for a tutorial soon!

    I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll"),
    a static website framework, and host it for free on
    [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com "Github Pages").
    This is my first-ever attempt at a web development project.
    It's been fascinating to learn the rudiments of
    command line, HTML, CSS, Javascript, YAML data files, and more.
    I'll be improving the site's aesthetics and functionality over time as my knowledge grows,
    as well as adding new posts to my blog. I am indebted to [Chuck Grimmett](http://cagrimmett.com "Chuck's personal site")
    for his inspiration and for this
    [helpful list of Jekyll resources](https://www.notion.so/Jekyll-Resources-61b89aaa0edf4eb49511bef51f5dec14 "Chuck rocks!")
    he created for me.
