This is wisdom on daily planning from a tweet by [Julian Shapiro](https://julian.com). Julian reviews this checklist each morning before he starts work:

1. Decide what has to happen today to maximize fulfillment by the day's end-- not by the hour.  
2. Delegate everything that can be delegated.  
3. Start with what must be finished today.  
4. Catch yourself when you procrastinate.  
You don't lack the time to do everything you want. You're just addicted to comfort.
