This is wisdom on daily planning from a tweet by [Julian Shapiro](https://julian.com). Julian reviews this checklist each morning before he starts work:

- [ ] Decide what has to happen today to maximize fulfillment by the day's end-- not by the hour.
- [ ] Delegate everything that can be delegated.
- [ ] Start with what must be finished today.
- [ ] Catch yourself when you procrastinate.  
You don't lack the time to do everything you want. You're just addicted to comfort.
