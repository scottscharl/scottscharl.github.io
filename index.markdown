I'm a husband and dad from Colorado.

I'm learning to code, and started building this site in August 2019 (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)) as part of a personal commitment to "rigorous leisure."

Connect with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_scharl) or [email](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com). Thank you for visiting!

## What I'm currently working on:

- **I'm looking for part-time work in customer support for a startup. If you know of an opportunity, please [email me](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com). View my [resume here](/resume).**

* [Blogging](/blog) here on my site.

* Rebuilding my [wife's website](https://jcscharl.com) using [Ghost](https://ghost.org).
