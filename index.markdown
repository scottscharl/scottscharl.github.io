I live in Colorado with my wife and two kids and am currently learning to code. I started building this site in August 2019 (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)) as part of a personal commitment to "rigorous leisure." Things escalated in late 2020 when I committed to a career change to tech.

## What I'm currently working on:

- I'm looking for part-time work in customer support for a startup. If you know of an opportunity, please [email me](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com). View my [resume here](/resume).

* [Blogging](/blog) here on my site.
