I'm a husband and dad (now of 2!) from Colorado. On this site I share projects I've built and point others to fascinating people and ideas.

I started building this site in August 2019 as part of my personal commitment to "rigorous leisure." My goal is to spend as much time as I can building little projects that I share with the world.

If you'd like to connect, I'm available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_scharl) or [email](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com). If you'd like to support my work, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/scottscharl)! Thank you for visiting!

## What I'm working on currently:
* Setting up Career Blues, my podcast about the meaning of work and the Good Life.

* Optimizing conversions on my Shopify store, [fintwit.store](https://fintwit.store).

* Taking an intro. to JavaScript course at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript).

* Increasing engagement for [QuoteBot](/quotebot), my bot that collects quotes from friends and posts them to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/squotebot).

* Reading [Zapier's](https://zapier.com) ebook *Introduction to API's*. If you're curious like me, You can [download the ebook for free here](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/learn_ebooks/e06a35cfcf092ec6dd22670383d9fd12.pdf).
