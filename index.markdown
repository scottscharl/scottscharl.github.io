![Scott's Headshot](/scott_new_headshot.jpg "Hello!")

I'm a husband and dad from Colorado.

I'm learning to code, and started building this site in August 2019 (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)) as part of a personal commitment to "rigorous leisure."

Connect with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_scharl) or [email](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com). Thank you for visiting!

## I'm currently working on:

* Looking for part-time work with a startup in customer support or community-building. (Know of something? Please [email me](mailto:hello@scottscharl.com) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_scharl)!)

* [Blogging](/blog) here on my site.

* Rebuilding my [wife's website](https://jcscharl.com) using [Ghost](https://ghost.org).
